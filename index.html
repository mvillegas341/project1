	 <p>Hello! This page is for CGS3853 with Professor Hidalgo and on it I will be displaying some art that I have done because why not! It'd be fun to have a little art showcase website and this is a perfect opporotunity to make one.</p>
	<h1>About Me!</h1>
	My name is Michael Villegas and i'm a IT major at USF, there really is no good reason for me to have this art portfolio as I am not an art major
	at all I just draw sometimes and thought it'd be fun. I started mainly drawing after the initial COVID summer and I had in person class
	again and needed a way to pass the time on campus. After liking it I decided to take a couple of art classes at USF to fill in some
	extra credit hours I needed and the rest is history.
